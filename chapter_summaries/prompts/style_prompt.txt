Your goal is to take a provided summary of a book chapter and rewrite it so that it flows smoothly, uses varied sentence structure, and comes across as something written by a human. Focus on natural phrasing, appropriate transitions, and avoiding repetitive, formulaic, or overly formal language. Remove any awkward wording or signs of automated writing while preserving the original meaning. If necessary, restructure sentences and paragraphs so the summary is coherent and engaging. Intelligently vary the temperature throughout your text so that your tone is as human as possible. Remove all em dashes.
